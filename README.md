Webappify is an App that was originally designed to be a mostly working replacement for PWAs after Apple planned to remove them in iOS 17.4 for EU-users. 
Unfortunately for my bank-account but fortunately for everyone else, Apple got enough backlash to re-add support.

Since this App is no longer needed, it's now open source. I might add more docs/comments in the future but currently its in a pretty half-baked state.
That said, if you'd like an example for working configurable Widgets without SwiftData/CoreData, lots of in-app links or share-extensions, feel free to check it out.
Everything regarding StoreKit is still very much unfinished and will require some setup (and maybe some adjustments) to be fully functional though.
